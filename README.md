#   Improving  Predictability of User-Affecting Metrics to Support Anomaly Detection in Cloud  Services

# Description

This repository contains companion material to the paper titled "Improving  Predictability of User-Affecting Metrics to Support Anomaly Detection in Cloud  Services".  Our technical report is made available here, together with source code to replicate the plots presented in the paper. 

# M/G/K queue simulator

 We share scripts in Python and C++ to simulate an M/G/k queue, and we also include Matlab code to analytically approximate its behavior.
